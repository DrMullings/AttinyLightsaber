This is a basic project to build a control board for lightsaber replicas

Required hardware:

  1. 1x ATtiny85
  2. 1x WT588D soundboard
  3. 1x 10ÂµF Capacitor
  4. 1x Swing sensor sw200d
  5. 1x Clash sensor sw18020p
  6. 1x Voltage regulator LM1117 (3,3V) (any other 3,3V regulator is good)
  7. 1x MosFet according to your LED setup (if you want to use the board in the fzz you need a sot223 package)
  8. 1x Momentary switch to turn your saber on and off (anti vandal switches are perfect)
  9. 1x LEDs for your blade (cree high power LEDs are very common for this)
  10. Either the board from the fzz or a selfmade board wired according to the fzz

How to use this one:

  1. Acquire Hardware
  2. Assemble Hardware
  3. Use your favorite IDE for Arduino with an ATtiny Plugin to upload the code to the Hardware
  4. Have fun
